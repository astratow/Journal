## Day 13 - Debugging
### Day 13 starts 14 of February 2021.
- I did this one in one day. I just listened to the lecture, I did some exercises, but really all this stuff was pretty basic to what I know already. Angela Yu was talking about principals of debugging:
- Describe a problem. Well, that is pretty obvious, so I am not eveng going through it.
- Reproduce bugs. This one I may need to replay, as I don't get it.
- Play computer. This means that you try to put yourself into the role of machine and try to think the way machine does.
- Use print. Throw results into the console. This helps a lot and I can sign under with hand and feet.
- Use debugger. Well, I guess there is some use of it, specially on the bigger projects, I have not found it helpful as yet.
- Take a break. Massive! Stefan Mischook advices to look at the problem just before sleep to focus your so called Lizard Brain. Somehow often after that you come up with the solution, which is absolute genius. It may take a night, it may take week or two, but it will come.
- Ask friend. Sadly I have no friends in developing world.
- Run code often. Yes, yes, easier said than done. I found it really hard to implement when I was doing PHP course, somehow the code was all over the place and I could not run it until I had a chunk of it... I messed up and it was too late to do anything... I am still looking for some answers now...
- Ask Stack Overflow. Well, my experience with this platform as active user is very negative, they removed my post saying it has been answered already. I did it on my own by taking a break :) So there you go!
