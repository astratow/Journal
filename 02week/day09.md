## Day 9
Day 9 starts 25 of January 2021. 
- I played around dictionaries, which is data collection type in Python. 25.01.2021
- I created [student grades](student_grades.py), an app that: goes through given dictionary with student names as keys and scores as values and markes them according to certain criteria as "Outstanding", "Exceeds Expectations", "Acceptable" or "Fail". I have done it myself, some refactoring added after watching solution, but purely cosmetic (using variable instead of dictionary entry in if statement: I used key[value] but she declared variable = key[value], which makes code shorter)
- Lots of theory around dictionaries and some exercises about forlooping those dictionaries.
- I have started to do [bidding app](bid.0.1.py) 27.01.2021
- I have finished day 9 with [bidding app](bid.0.5.py). I used different naming and I made user interface a little friendlier by using y/n instead yes/no.
