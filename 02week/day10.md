# Angela Yu - Python Course
## Day 10
Day 10 starts 29 of January 2021. 
- A little bit of theory:)
- I did app, which returns number of days in the given month of the year. It went smooth, I found it easy as I knew a lot of stuff. Here is the [source](month_check.py)
- I learnt about docstring.
- I am writing [calculator app](calc.0.1.py). The way lady Yu does it is pretty long winding, but let see what comes out of it!
- I continue to write [calculator app](calc.0.2.py). It has added functionality, but I am not quite sure how it all works.. 1.02.2021
- I finished [calculator app](calc.0.2.py). I added extra thing in the interface, but I still dislike it... Improving it would take a lot more time and is beyond the scope of this course, so I won't do it now. Besides there is so many great calculator out there, I have little motivation to work on my own. In general creating it was nice experience, sometimes frustrating. I don't get how it transfers dictionary keys into inputs, but I made funny bug by putting ':' for divide and after that used '/' all the way. When I tried it, it came with an error. I laughed when I saw it.  
What could be done here is user experience, which is pretty terrible. She finally decided to use letters instead of whole words for inputs, which great bliss, but there is more to do.
