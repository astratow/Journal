# Angela Yu - Python Course
## Day 10
Day 10 starts 29 of January 2021. 
- A little bit of theory:)
- I did app, which returns number of days in the given month of the year. It went smooth, I found it easy as I knew a lot of stuff. Here is the [source](month_check.py)
- I learnt about docstring.
- I am writing [calculator app](calc.0.1.py). The way lady Yu does it is pretty long winding, but let see what comes out of it!
- I continue to write [calculator app]{calc.0.2.py}. It has added functionality, but I am not quite sure how it all works.. 1.02.2021
