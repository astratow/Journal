# Angela Yu - Python Course
### Day 14
### Day 14 starts 16 of February 2021. 
- I have started to code LowereHigher game. I checked data length, created random picker for two values. I need to output it nicely and compare. After I finish this, I will be intermediate Python programmer! Wow! 
- I added player selection and right/wrong response. I need to add loops.
- Added some loops and game is playable, but I need to remove answer from the selection, and we will be good! Getting there! [Here](Lower_Higher/LowerHigher-0.1.py) is the source code.
- I watched the solution and it was quite different setup to what I did, but I am quite happy with my version and I will work on it to polish last bits.
- I removed revealing answer prior to guess using if statement:) I found it pretty clever solution. I also polished up a little bit of user experience. [here](Lower_Higher/LowerHigher-0.1.py) is main source code. You need to add [this](Lower_Higher/game_data.py) to play.
