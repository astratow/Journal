# Angela Yu - Python Course
### Day 14
### Day 14 starts 16 of February 2021. 
- I have started to code LowereHigher game. I checked data length, created random picker for two values. I need to output it nicely and compare. After I finish this, I will be intermediate Python programmer! Wow! 
- I added player selection and right/wrong response. I need to add loops.
- Added some loops and game is playable, but I need to remove answer from the selection, and we will be good! Getting there! [Here](Lower_Higher/LowerHigher-0.1.py) is the source code.
