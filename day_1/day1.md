## Day 1
Today is my 214 day of coding as per #100DaysOfCode challenge thing, but it is
not all about coding. Sometimes I have to organise other stuf or just read and
there is not a lot to put on #GitHub. That is why I decided to try this format.
Sort of  bloging thing. See where we get here.
Today I watched Edwin Diaz course - not so much done. I also have done one of
JavaScript lessons on FreeCodeCamp.org, it was actually last in Alghorithms
section and I was cheating there (I used solution).
