# Angela Yu - Python Course
I learnt following:
print()
input()
len()
variables
At the end of the chapter I was asked to do script that welcomes, asks for city I grew up in name and pet name, then joins it together and gives band name. My code is in the [band_name_generator.py](band_name_generator.py)
