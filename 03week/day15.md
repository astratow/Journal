# Angela Yu - Python Course
### Day 15
### Day 15 starts 20 of February 2021. 
*Starting new week and intermediate level of Python programming course!
- I listened to installation instructions for Python and PyCharm.
- I listened about digital coffee vending machine project, but it seem so out of reality, that I am not sure if I want to do it.
- I decided to do it along... But with my personal touch. I added one letter functionality, which means one letter can trigger the option instead of writing whole word as Andrea does. Another thing is that I used for loop to print report instead of print statements. It's pretty cool :)
- I made this coffee machine. Due to bad indentation I had an error. I struggled to pay attention as I disliked the concept very much. I kept my simplified interface, so user does not have to write whole word to call coffee - it made my debugging a lot easier too. I kept my naming as well, which is simplier than what Andrea suggests. Overall, not too bad, but not my cup of... coffee :)
