# Angela Yu - Python Course
### Day 16
### Day 16 starts 24 of February 2021. 
*Starting new week and intermediate level of Python programming course!
- For now I skipped writing coffee machine simulator. It seem to be silly project, not too appealing. I may go back to it in some point.
- I went into OOP and I listened to the lecture about it, plus I started to play with turtle graphic library, which is what Stefan Mischook does too. I created simple file called [turtle_play.py](turtle_play.py)
- 25.02.2021 Day off. Kids playing up since 4AM!
- I played around PrettyTable. I created a table with add_column() method and changed align attribute. Pretty fun.
- Happy Birthday
