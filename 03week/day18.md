[INDEX](../README.md)
### Day 18
### Day 18 starts 25 of March 2021. 
- I started to listen about turtle module.
- I wrote a [turtle shapes generator](Day-18/Turtle-shapes.py).
- I work on [random walk](Day-18/random-walk.py)
- I wrote an app, that draws circle. She called it [sphirograph](Day-18/sphirograph.py)
- Not very Python day - I opened Wordpress hosting account and started to work on my website...
- I started to work on Hirst Project
- I had a break from Python yesterday, because my son woke up and I had to cuddle him:) Today I finished Hirst Project. It makes Hirst like paintings on 10x10 square you get random colourfull dots. It's pretty cool. I wonder if JavaScript has library that could do similar effects?
