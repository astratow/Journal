# Angela Yu - Python Course
## Day 3
- I wrote [bmi calculator](bmi_calc2.0.py) which tells you if you underweight, in shape or too fat.
- I wrote [leap year checker](leap_year_check.py) which checks if given year is leap. It is actually more advanced thing than suggested in exercise. It also goes upside down compare to Angela Yu logic - it checks % 400, % 100 and finally % 4
- I wrote [pizza billing calculator](pizza_billing.py) it took me few days as I went into rabbit whole with if statemenents. I wanted program to recognise capitals as well as lowcases, which is extra comparing to Angela's version. My approach towards if statements was a bit messed up. Hence gray dot at github. It took me 2 days to do just this one ;)
