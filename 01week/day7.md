# Angela Yu - Python Course
## Day 7
- I did first bit of coding for hangman game. I will call it [hang-0.1](hang-0.1.py). User selects letter and program goes through randomly selcted word and checks if it's been used. It throws true or false respectively. The request wasn't precisely worded in the comment so I only did the if statement to start of, but corrected while watching solution.
