# Angela Yu - Python Course
## Day 6
## It is New Year 2021 when I start this, so Happy New Year!
- This day is just playing with [reborg](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html). I wrote a program which takes a robot all the way through obstacles and I called it [RobotRun!](robRun.py)
- Third day I managed to write little script to get robot out of the maze. It is called [Maze Path Finder](MazePathFinder.py). This is final project for day 6.
