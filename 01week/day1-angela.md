# Angela Yu - Python Course
* I learnt following:
- print()
- input()
- len()
- variables
- google searching in order to solve problems
* At the end of the chapter I was asked to do script that welcomes, asks for city I grew up in name and pet name, then joins it together and gives band name. My code is in the [band_name_generator.py](band_name_generator.py)
* It took my 2 days to do 1 chapter.
* To explain variables Angela used cups analogy, which is quite good, although not perfect - it is logical, but in real life it has little sense. But that is fine. 
* For a moment I am giving her 4/5.
