## Day 5
- I wrote [Average Height Calculator](av_height.py). Loops in Python are weird... I had to look up at solution.
- I wrote [Highest Score Finder](highest_score.py). It was fairly easy as I got to understand loop syntax in Python now (it replaces iteration with simple declaring i) and remembering that I have done it during my JavaScript course on freeCodeCamp. I think these challenges are pretty hard if you have no experience and want to do them from scratch.
- I wrote [EvenSum100](EvenSum100.py) program which counts all even numbers from 2 to 100. It is another day of 5th chapter today :)
