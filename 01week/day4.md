## Day 4
- I wrote [Heads or Tails](heads_tails.py) game. You selecting h/H for Head or t/T. Program throws error message if wrong key selected.
- I wrote [Banker's Roulette](bank_roul.py) program to choose name from the name list. Horrible little thing!
- I struggled with [Treasure Island Map](map.py). I did it by watching video at the end. I could not work out how to put pieces together:(
- I wrote [Rock Paper Scissors](rps.py) game. It was fairly easy as I written similar thing in JavaScript before.
